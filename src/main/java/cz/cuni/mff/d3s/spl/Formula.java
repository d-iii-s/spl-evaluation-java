 * She then binds the aliases to actual random variables.
 * Before evaluating, it is necessary to set the mathematical apparatus
 * used for evaluating.
 * The apparatus can be used to determine relation between two random variables
 * (greater/smaller, etc.).
 * The evaluate then returns result of the evaluation at the time of calling
