<p>Evaluation engine of Performance Stochastic Logic for Java.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Stochastice Performance Logic is a formalism for capturing performance
assumptions.
It is, for example, possible to capture assumption that newer version of
a function <code>bar</code> is faster than the previous version or that library
<code>foobar</code> is faster than library <code>barfoo</code> when
rendering antialiased text.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this framework is to allow evaluation of SPL formulas
inside Java applications.
</p>
<p>More information about SPL is available at
<a href="http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/software/spl">http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/software/spl</a>.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The framework expects that the user has the actual data ready and only
wants to evaluate them inside SPL.
Thus, the framework offers two concepts only: data sources
({@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.Data} interface) and formulas
({@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.Formula} interface).


<h3>Data sources</h3>
<p>
Data sources that represent input data fed into SPL formulas.
Typically, these input data are derived from method execution times but they
can also represent system load or last level cache misses.
</p>
<p>
Formulas requires the {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.Data} interface, but typically
one would use {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.DataStore} that allows to add new
samples.
To this end, there is {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.data.SlidingWindowDataStore}
that implements a ring-buffer storing the last added samples.
</p>

<h3>Formulas</h3>
<p>
Formulas are the heart of the framework.
They use the Stochastic Performance Logic to express assumptions/questions
about application performance.
They are represented by the {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.Formula} interface.
</p>
<p>
Although one can use implementation from {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.formula}
to build the formula, it is easier to express the formula as a string and
parse it with {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.formula.SplFormula#create}.
</p>
<p>
Individual variables in the formula must always be binded to concrete data
sources prior formula evaluation.
This allows you to reuse to formula with different data sources
(e.g. modeled performance vs. actually measured performance).
Different interpretation of the formula can be used as well
(see {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.spl.MathematicalInterpretation}).
